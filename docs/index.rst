      **AstrOmakase** is an optimised Ubuntu 24.04 setup specifically designed for astronomers and astrophysicists. It builds on the foundation of the `Omakub project <https://github.com/basecamp/omakub>`_, offering a curated and comprehensive environment that includes all the essential tools needed for astronomical research and development.

What is AstrOmakase?
--------------------

AstrOmakase is more than just a collection of software. It is a thoughtfully crafted setup tailored to streamline your research workflow.

The name "AstrOmakase" combines "astronomy" with the Japanese word "omakase," which means "I'll leave it up to you." Just as in an omakase dining experience, where the chef selects and prepares a personalized meal, AstrOmakase provides a tailored software environment, allowing you to focus on your research without worrying about configuring each tool individually.

Installation
------------

AstrOmakase simplifies the setup process, enabling you to focus on your research and development tasks without the hassle of manual configuration.

.. note::
   AstrOmakase is inspired by the `Omakub project <https://github.com/basecamp/omakub>`_. While it can function independently, it is recommended to install Omakub first for a better experience. For more details, visit the `Omakub website <https://omakub.org/>`_ and `documentation <https://manual.omakub.org/>`_.

   To install Omakub:

   .. code-block:: bash

      wget -qO- https://omakub.org/install | bash


Run the following script to install AstrOmakase on your Ubuntu 24.04 system:

.. code-block:: bash

   wget -qO- https://lorenzomugnai.github.io/AstrOmakase/installer.sh | bash

During the installation, if Omakub is not detected, you will be prompted with the option to install it.

.. important::
   If you choose to install Omakub, the installer will proceed with the Omakub installation.
   **After Omakub is installed**, you will need to log out and log back in to apply the necessary environment changes.
   Once you have logged back in, **rerun the AstrOmakase installation script to complete the setup** process.
   If you choose not to install Omakub:

.. note::
   If you choose to not install Omakub, the installation will continue without Omakub.
   Note that some features may be limited or unavailable without Omakub.

How to Update
--------------

AstrOmakase can be easily updated from the dedicated executable:

The app also shows the installed version. The user can launch the application from console running `astromakase`, or with the dedicated launcher.

The Menu
