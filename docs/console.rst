fastfetch is a fast and efficient system information tool written in Rust. It provides a quick overview of system details, including hardware and software information, in a visually appealing format. With its minimalistic design, fastfetch allows users to easily access essential system information from the command line, making it a useful tool for both troubleshooting and system monitoring.

**fd**
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

fd is a simple, fast, and user-friendly alternative to the traditional `find` command. It offers enhanced search capabilities with a more intuitive syntax, making it easier to locate files and directories on your filesystem. fd supports features like file previewing, fuzzy searching, and custom colour schemes, providing a more efficient and enjoyable file searching experience.

**htop** and **btop**
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

htop and btop are interactive process viewers for Unix systems that offer a more user-friendly and informative way to monitor system processes compared to traditional tools like `top`.

**htop** provides a dynamic, real-time view of system processes, CPU usage, memory consumption, and more. Its visual interface includes colour-coded bars and a tree view of processes, allowing users to quickly identify and manage system resources.

**btop** offers similar functionality to htop but with additional features and a more modern, customisable interface. It provides detailed information on system performance, including network activity and disk usage, and allows users to navigate and manage processes with ease.

**lt**
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

lt is a tool for listing files and directories in a tree-like format. It provides a clear and hierarchical view of your filesystem, making it easier to navigate and understand the structure of your directories and files. With options for custom formatting and depth control, lt offers flexibility in how file structures are displayed.

**plocate**
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

plocate is a tool designed for quickly locating files on the filesystem. It builds an index of file locations, allowing for fast and efficient searches. plocate is particularly useful for users who need to frequently find files without waiting for slow, on-the-fly searches.

**screen**
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

screen is a terminal multiplexer that allows you to manage multiple terminal sessions within a single window. It provides the ability to create, switch between, and detach from multiple terminal sessions, making it an essential tool for managing long-running processes, remote sessions, and multitasking within the terminal.

**zoxide**
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

zoxide is a fast, flexible, and smart directory jumper that enhances navigation within the filesystem. It learns which directories you visit most frequently and provides a quick way to jump to those locations using a simple command. zoxide's intelligent matching and history-based suggestions make directory navigation faster and more efficient.

**Speedtest** (optional)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Speedtest is a tool for measuring the performance of your network connection, including download and upload speeds, latency, and overall connection quality. It provides a quick and easy way to test and monitor your internet performance from the command line, helping you diagnose network issues and ensure optimal connectivity.
