Coding Tools
============

This section provides an overview of the coding tools included in AstrOmakase. These tools are essential for coding, version control, and development tasks, offering robust features to enhance productivity and streamline the coding process.

Because nowday most of the codes are written in Python, the tools listed here are focused on Python development. However, many of these tools are versatile and can be used for other programming languages as well.

**Anaconda**
+++++++++++++

`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_ is a popular open-source distribution platform for data science and machine learning. It includes a comprehensive collection of tools and libraries for data analysis, scientific computing, and statistical modelling. Anaconda simplifies the management of different Python environments and packages, making it easier to handle project dependencies and versioning.

With Anaconda, users can easily create isolated environments for various projects, ensuring that different libraries and dependencies do not interfere with each other. The platform also includes the Conda package manager, which facilitates the installation and management of packages and libraries required for different data science and development tasks.

Anaconda's integrated development environment, Jupyter Notebook, allows for interactive coding and data visualisation, making it a powerful tool for exploratory data analysis and creating reproducible research. Overall, Anaconda provides a comprehensive ecosystem for managing and developing data-driven projects efficiently.

**PreCommit**
+++++++++++++

`PreCommit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks. These hooks automatically run scripts to check code quality and enforce coding standards before changes are committed to a version control system.

PreCommit integrates with popular version control systems like Git to automate tasks such as linting, formatting, and testing. By using PreCommit, developers can ensure that their code adheres to consistent style guidelines and is free from common errors before it is committed to a repository.

The tool’s configuration is simple, allowing users to define a set of hooks that will be executed automatically during the commit process. This helps to maintain high code quality and reduces the likelihood of introducing issues into the codebase.


**VSCode**
+++++++++++++

`Visual Studio Code (VSCode) <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ is a powerful and widely-used code editor developed by Microsoft. It offers a rich set of features that cater to a wide range of development tasks, from web development to data science. VSCode provides support for multiple programming languages through extensions, making it a versatile choice for various coding projects.

Key features of VSCode include a built-in terminal, integrated debugging tools, and an extensive library of extensions available through the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. These extensions enable users to add functionality for language support, linting, version control, and more, allowing for a highly customisable development environment.

VSCode’s user-friendly interface and robust feature set make it a popular choice among developers for coding, debugging, and managing projects efficiently. Its support for collaborative coding through Live Share and seamless integration with Git further enhances its appeal as a comprehensive development tool.

**GitHub CLI**
++++++++++++++

`GitHub CLI (gh) <https://cli.github.com/>`_ is a powerful command-line interface tool that allows developers to interact with GitHub directly from the terminal. It simplifies common tasks such as managing repositories, creating issues, and reviewing pull requests by providing a set of intuitive commands that streamline workflow.

With GitHub CLI, users can perform a wide range of GitHub-related tasks without leaving the command line environment. This includes cloning repositories, creating and merging pull requests, and managing issues and discussions. The tool’s integration with GitHub’s API ensures that users can access and manage their GitHub projects efficiently and effectively.

GitHub CLI enhances productivity by providing a more streamlined and scriptable way to interact with GitHub, making it an invaluable tool for developers who prefer to work within a terminal-based workflow.
